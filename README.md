# R-Survival-of-cancer-patients
This project demonstrates how to analyze missing data about cancer patients using survival analysis techniques. It involves data cleaning, formatting, and modeling to examine various factors and determine which are significantly correlated with the chances of survival.

Steps:
1) Data Cleaning
Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
2) Data Formatting
Prepare the data for analysis by formatting it appropriately.
3) Modeling
Perform survival analysis to identify significant factors affecting patient survival.
The final model is represented as:
ùë¶ = sex + ph.ecog
where y represents the chances of survival, and ph.ecog is the physician's rating of the patient's health on a scale from 1 to 5.
